# mani
ayye wassup, the mani project is basically a multifunctional app that people with creativity and mindset can use. it will also have a website but
more on that later. 
you can show what have you done and how good are you in certain things, for example an 11 year old knows how to write in javascript,
many features of it will be AI powered and most probably AI is going to also replace the support "team"
